<!-- l. 58 --><p class='noindent'>This must be the way.
</p><!-- l. 61 --><p class='indent'>   Here is <span id='textcolor1'><span class='underline'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVszm8EJRTq/'>a video</a></span></span> of a great passing pattern executed by Jorge Vilchis and Santiago
Malabari. This pattern is fast, it’s lively, and it has some really interesting symmetry.
Part of what makes this pattern so lively is that the two of them are never throwing
at the same time, Jorge is throwing right in between Santi’s throws. There’s the
visual element of the one blue club being passed back and forth. Plus there’s a
pleasant symmetry that Jorge and Santi are making all the same throws, but
staggered in time from each other. The overall effect is similar to a feeling of
watching popcorn pop.
</p><!-- l. 63 --><p class='indent'>   Passing patterns like this, where the two jugglers are doing the same thing but at
different times, arise from solo patterns via a process called the Préchac
transformation, named after the French juggler and mathematician Christophe
Préchac who discovered them in 1999. This document aims to investigate the
beautiful math that makes these patterns possible, and to answer some natural
questions that show up. For jugglers, I have personally found that understanding the
theory of these patterns has made it much easier for me to juggle them, I find more
joy in watching them, and certainly it is certainly easier for me to generate new
patterns designed to my preferences. The basic idea is that you take an individual
throw, and share its flight time among multiple jugglers. For mathematicians, I think
there is some very satisfying math going on as well. After all, how can you
watch <span id='textcolor2'><span class='underline'><a href='https://youtu.be/GC_fLpkLye8'>prechac with my friends</a></span></span> and not want to juggle and understand these
patterns?
</p><!-- l. 65 --><p class='indent'>   Some familiarity with solo siteswaps is helpful, but we’ll build the theory from the
ground up, with a slightly different perspective than usual that will be amenable to
where we’re going. We’ll start with some mathematical preliminaries to aid us in our
discussion of these patterns.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='notation-and-mathematical-preliminaries'><span class='titlemark'>2   </span> <a id='x1-30002'></a>Notation and mathematical preliminaries</h3>
<!-- l. 72 --><p class='noindent'>We will be using functions a lot, so we recall some of their most important properties.
We recall that if we have two sets \(A\) and \(B\) a function \(f : A \to B\) is an association that associates
to every element of \(A\) a unique element of \(B\). The element associated to an element \(a\) in \(A\)
is written as \(f(a)\). So if \(a\) is associated to \(b\), then we have \(f(a) = b\). For instance, if \(P\) is the set of all
people who have ever lived, and \(T\) is the set of all moments in time there have ever
been, we get a function \(f : P \to T\) sending a person to the exact time of their birth. So
maybe f(my friend John) = 3:55pm eastern standard time on March 15th,
1995.
</p><!-- l. 74 --><p class='indent'>   The main property of functions that interests us is that they can compose. That
is, if we have two functions \(f : A \to B\) and \(g : B \to C\), then we get a new function \(g \circ f : A \to C\) (read aloud as “\(g\)
composed with \(f\)”) defined by \(g \circ f(a) = g(f(a))\). This makes sense as \(f(a)\) is an element of \(B\), and so \(g\)
associates to it an element of \(C\).
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 76 --><p class='indent'>   For instance, if we let \(Y\) denote the collection of all years, and again let \(T\) denote the
collection of all moments in time, we have a function \(g : T \to Y\) sending a moment in time to
the year that moment occurred. So for instance g(3:55pm eastern standard time on
March 15th, 1995) = 1995. Considering the function \(f : P \to T\) sending a person to the
moment they were born, we have the new function \(g \circ f : P \to Y\) sending a person to
their birth year, and in particular we have \[ g \circ f(\text {my friend John}) = g(\text {3:55pm eastern standard time on March 15th, 1995}) = 1995, \] saying that John was born in
1995.
</p><!-- l. 82 --><p class='indent'>   There is a special class of functions we will work with a lot, the so-called
“invertible” functions. Namely, a function \(f : A \to B\) is said to be invertible precisely when it
yields a perfect translation between \(A\) and \(B\). That is, if we think of \(f\) as translating from \(A\)
to \(B\), then we can translate back from \(B\) to \(A\) via another function \(g : B \to A\). This translation
means that if we translate from \(A\), then to \(B\), then back to \(A\), we should have done
nothing. That is, we should have \(g \circ f(a) = a\) for all \(a\) in \(A\), and similarly \(f \circ g(b) = b\) for all \(b\) in \(B\). This relation
is expressed by saying that \(g\) and \(f\) are inverses to each other, often written as
\(g = f^{-1}\).
</p><!-- l. 84 --><p class='indent'>   Indeed, if we consider two languages like say English and Spanish then the
goal of an interpreter is to build translation functions \(f : \) English \(\to \) Spanish
and \(g : \) Spanish \(\to \) English. How can we tell if the translator is doing a good
job? Say a person says a sentence \(S\) in Spanish, and that gets interpreted
to a sentence \(f(S) = E\) in English. If the interpreter was to translate that same
sentence back into Spanish, we should have \(g(E) = S\). That is, \(g \circ f(S) = S\), and similarly
\(f \circ g(E) = E\).<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='A_Geometric_Theory_Of_Prechac_Transformations2.html#fn1x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>1</sup></a></span><a id='x1-3001f1'></a> 
</p><!-- l. 86 --><p class='indent'>   We can get a more scientific example if we consider the conversion between
temperatures measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Indeed, if we have a temperature \(C\) in
degrees celsius, that’s the same temperature as \(T(C) = \frac {9}{5}C + 32\) in Fahrenheit. This can be undone
by the translations \(T^{-1}(F) = \frac {5}{9}(F - 32)\) sending a temperature in Fahrenheit to the temperature in
Celsius, and again the key feature is that if we translate from Celsius to Fahrenheit,
then back to Celsius, we get the same temperature we started with. See if you can
prove this!
</p><!-- l. 88 --><p class='indent'>   If we consider the identity function \(\operatorname {id} : A \to A\) defined by \(\operatorname {id}(a) = a\) for all \(a\) in \(A\) (so named as each
element maintains its identity), then the statement that functions \(f\) and \(g\) are inverses
is the statement that \(g \circ f = \operatorname {id}\) and \(f \circ g = \operatorname {id}\).
</p><!-- l. 90 --><p class='indent'>   We will have occasion to write diagrams of functions between sets as
follows:
</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='commuting-triangle' border='0' src='https://i.ibb.co/r2w0LzB/commuting-triangle.png' style='width:250px;height:auto;' /></p>

<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='commuting-square' border='0' src='https://i.ibb.co/2MhbpGk/commuting-square.png' style='width:259px;height:auto;' /></p>

                                                                  

                                                                  
<!-- l. 119 --><p class='indent'>   where \(A, B, C, D\) are sets, and \(e, f, g, h\) are functions between these sets. In these diagrams, we
move along arrows, composing the functions that label the arrows. We will
say that a diagram commutes when any path we take between two sets,
composing the functions along the way, yields the same overall function. The first
diagram pictured commutes exactly when \(h = g \circ f\), that is, for any \(a\) in \(A\) we’d have
\(h(a) = g(f(a))\). The second diagram commutes exactly when \(g \circ e = h \circ f\), that is, when \(g(e(a)) = h(f(a))\) for all \(a\) in
\(A\).
</p><!-- l. 121 --><p class='indent'>   If you haven’t seen this notation, here are two commutative diagrams expressing
facts about arithmetic. Let \(\mathbb {Z}\) denote the set of all the integers, so \(\mathbb {Z} = \{\dots , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}\). Let \(+2 : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}\) be
the function defined by \(+2(n) = 2 + n\), let \(+3: \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}\) be the function defined by \(+3(n) = 3 + n\), and let \(+5 : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}\) be the
function defined by \(+5(n) = 5 + n\). The statement that \(5 = 2 + 3\) is expressed in the commutative
diagram
</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='commuting-triangle-addition' border='0' src='https://i.ibb.co/SvzFw8m/commuting-triangle-addition.png' style='width:250px;height:auto;' /></p>

<!-- l. 136 --><p class='indent'>   That is, if you add three to something, then add 2 to the result, it’s the same as
adding 5 to what you started with. Or in symbols \(2 + (3 + n) = 5 + n\). Similarly, the statement that \(2 + 3 = 3 + 2\) can
be expressed in the commutative diagram </p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='commuting-square-addition' border='0' src='https://i.ibb.co/59CQWbw/commuting-square-addition.png' style='width:250px;height:auto;' /></p>

<!-- l. 150 --><p class='indent'>   These diagrams are useful as they convey equalities of functions in a visual
manner that keeps things organized and engages the brain’s vast wealth of visual
processing power.
</p><!-- l. 152 --><p class='indent'>   Throughout, we will write the letter \(p\) after a given throw in a juggling
pattern to denote that that throw is a pass, all other throws are assumed
selves. We will let \(\mathbb {Z}\) denote the integers, \(\mathbb {N}\) denote the non-negative integers
(so in particular \(\mathbb {N}\) includes 0), and for any integer \(n\) we will let \(\mathbb {Z}/n\) denote the
the group of rotations of the \(n\)-gon sending vertices to vertices. Usually \(n\) will
be the period of the juggling pattern in question. We have the function \(C : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}/n\)
where \(C(i)\) is the rotation by \(i\) turns clockwise, or if you prefer by an angle of \(\frac {i}{n} \cdot 2\pi \)
radians, or \(\frac {i}{n} \cdot 360\) degrees clockwise, or a fraction \(i/n\) of a full clockwise rotation. We
will also on occasion write \(C(i) = \overline {i}\), don’t worry if this function \(C\) is meaningless
to you write now, understanding it will be the project of this upcoming
section.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='keeping-time-on-a-jugglers-clock'><span class='titlemark'>3   </span> <a id='x1-40003'></a>Keeping time on a juggler’s clock</h3>
<!-- l. 181 --><p class='noindent'>Many juggling patterns have a periodic nature to them, where after a certain amount
of time they loop back to where they started and run again. The key to our analysis
will be to capture this periodic behavior as geometrically as possible. To do this, we
consider one of the most common periodic phenomena we all observe in our
day to day lives, the marking of time. Every 24 hours we’re back at the
same time of day, every 7 days we’re back at the same day of the week,
                                                                  

                                                                  
usually every 365 days we’re back at the same day of the year, and every 12
hours we’re back at the same time on the clock, time always looping back on
itself.
</p><!-- l. 183 --><p class='indent'>   For the most geometric interpretation, we’ll focus on the clock, though we’ll
slightly renumber things so that the clock runs from 0 to 11 o’clock, rather than 1 to
12 o’clock (this is more similar to 24-hour time), so that 12 o’clock is now 0 o’clock.
Here’s where this is going: Say a juggler is juggling a 3-beat pattern where it repeats
every third throw. Then we can imagine that juggler as juggling to the tick of a clock
with 3 marked points, as opposed to our 12-hour clock with its 12 tick-points. Then
the statement that the pattern repeats every third beat is saying that whenever the
juggler’s clock comes back around to the same point, they make the same
throw.
</p><!-- l. 185 --><p class='indent'>   Our goal here is to be more precise about the nature of arithmetic on clocks, so
that we can eventually plot out juggling patterns as diagrams on clocks, building
up the geometric foundation for the Préchac transformation. This visual
representation of juggling patterns serves a similar purpose to sheet music for
musicians. Both situations share the same phenomenon of the means of counting
time looping back on itself, like counting in 4/4 time as 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4,
...
</p><!-- l. 187 --><p class='indent'>   As a first question, we ask: How do we figure out where on the clock we are at any
given time? For instance, if we’re currently at 3 o’clock, what time will it be 145
hours from now?
</p><!-- l. 189 --><p class='indent'>   To be a little more formal about this, suppose that we have agreed that time 0 is
reprsented as 0 o’clock. Then for any integer \(0 \leq i \leq 11\), let \(\overline {i}\) be the tick-mark for \(i\) o’clock,
thought of as a position on the clock. Let \(T = \{\overline {0}, \overline {1}, \dots , \overline {11}\}\) denote the set of all hour tick-marks. Then
we should have a function \(C : \mathbb {Z} \to T\) (think C for clock and T for tick-marks), where any time
that’s an integer number of hours from time 0 should land at some tick-mark on the
clock <span class='footnote-mark'><a href='A_Geometric_Theory_Of_Prechac_Transformations3.html#fn2x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>2</sup></a></span><a id='x1-4001f2'></a> .
</p><!-- l. 191 --><p class='indent'>   Let’s make some observations about this function \(C\). First off, by construction we
have \(\overline {i} = C(i)\) for \(0 \leq i &lt; 11\), and \(C(12) = \overline {0}\), 12 hours later we’re back to the top of the clock. Since integers like
to be added together, and are built by successively adding many copies of 1, to figure
out where the rest of the numbers go, it will be helpful to figure out how this
function \(C\) interacts with addition.
</p><!-- l. 193 --><p class='indent'>   For instance, suppose you know \(C(x) = \overline {5}\), and you want to know the value of \(C(1 + x)\). This is the
time it will be one hour later, which is \(\overline {6}\). Similarly if you knew \(C(x) = \overline {11}\), then we’d get \(C(1 + x) = \overline {0}\). In
general, \(C(1 + x)\) is the next tickmark, read clockwise around the clock. That is, if you take
any input starting time, the time it will be in one hour is the time you land on if you
rotate one turn of the clock from the starting time, or 1/12th of the way around.
That is, the act of allowing one hour of time to pass is represented on the clock as
rotating one unit clockwise. Here is an animation of the process that might clear
things up.
</p>
                                                                  

                                                                  
 <p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='one_rotation' border='0' src='https://i.ibb.co/9VL0kQV/rotation-twelve-once-Manim-CE-v0-16-0-post0.gif' style='width:500px;height:auto;' /></p>
 
<!-- l. 206 --><p class='indent'>   Similarly, if we were to allow time to move forwards by 4 hours, then we’d be
interested in the value of \(C(4 + x)\). Then this would be equivalent to rotating the clock 4 units
clockwise, or 4/12th of the way around, as in this gif .
</p>
 <p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='four_rotations' src='https://i.ibb.co/PFk2JJy/rotation-twelve-four-Manim-CE-v0-16-0-post0.gif' style='width:450px;height:auto;' /></p>
 
<!-- l. 215 --><p class='indent'>   Notice in particular that 4 hours after 8 o’clock is 12 o’clock, which we’ve
represented as 0 o’clock, and similarly that 4 hours after 11 o’clock is 15 o’clock = 3
o’clock.
</p><!-- l. 217 --><p class='indent'>   And finally, we could also ask for any given time on the clock, what
time was it 2 hours ago, the value of \(C(-2 + x)\)? This is equivalent to rotating all our
times counterclockwise by 2 units and noting where they land, as in this
gif.
</p>
 <p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='rotate_back' src='https://i.ibb.co/sqLbGRD/rotation-twelve-back-Manim-CE-v0-16-0-post0.gif' style='width:450px;height:auto;' /></p>
 
<!-- l. 227 --><p class='indent'>   Thus, we have a correspondence where allowing any amount of time
to pass and asking what that does to times on the clock is equivalent to
rotating the clock by that amount. That is, if we let \(R_{12}\) be the collection of all
possible rotations of this 12-sided clock which send hour tick-marks to hour
tick-marks, then we have a function \(C_{\text {rot}} : \mathbb {Z} \to R_{12}\) where \(C(n + x) = C_{\text {rot}}(n)\big (C(x)\big )\), where \(C_{\text {rot}}(n)\) is the rotation we get by
allowing \(n\) hours to pass on the clock, and \(C_{\text {rot}}(-n)\) is the rotation we get by sending
times on the clock to the time it was \(n\) hours ago. We could have just as well
started from \(C_{\text {rot}}\) and built \(C\), as \[ C(x) = C(x + 0) = C_{\text {rot}}(x)(C(0)) = C_{\text {rot}}(x)(\overline {0}). \] That is, knowing what time on the clock it is at
time \(x\) is the same as knowing what time on the clock it is \(x\) hours after time
0.
</p><!-- l. 232 --><p class='indent'>   There are a number of features of this function \(C_{\text {rot}}\) that are worth highlighting.
Philosophically, the function \(C\) thinks of integers as individual points on the number
line, and we are sending points on the number line to tick-marks on the clock. The
function \(C_{\text {rot}}\) doesn’t output points, it outputs rotational actions, so it would be nice if
we had a corresponding way to think of the integers as actions, so that \(C_{\text {rot}}\) sends actions
to actions, and \(C\) sends points to points.
</p><!-- l. 234 --><p class='indent'>   To do this, let \(\mathbb {Z}_{\text {slide}}\) be the collection of all sliding actions on the number line that send
integers to integers. We have a function \(\text {point} : \mathbb {Z}_{\text {slide}} \to \mathbb {Z}\) sending a sliding action \(s\) to the point \(s(0)\). This
function is invertible, with inverse sending a point \(i\) to the sliding action that is
addition by \(i\). This is the unique sliding action that sends 0 to \(i\). Here is a gif of the
correspondence for the number 3.
</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='slide' border='0' src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ei2HDAz5kdSj5iOgU1/giphy.gif' style='width:500px;height:auto;' /></p>

                                                                  

                                                                  
<!-- l. 243 --><p class='indent'>   Note for instance that the statement that \(3 + 2 = 5\) says that after sliding
over by 3 units, the number 2 lands on top of the number 5, and indeed
for any number \(x\), after sliding over by 3 units it lands on top of \(3 + x\)
<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='A_Geometric_Theory_Of_Prechac_Transformations4.html#fn3x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>3</sup></a></span><a id='x1-4002f3'></a>. The
juggler’s relationship to this duality is that the we think of the beats in time at which
we throw like the points on a number line, and a throw that starts at some time and
lands at another time as corresponding to the sliding action that takes the first time
to the second. The arc of a ball in the air is equated to the active passage of
time, and the moments when we throw or catch a ball are points on the
timeline.
</p><!-- l. 245 --><p class='indent'>   Now we build a similar dual perspective on the clock, between rotations on the
clock and the hour tick-marks. To do this, note that since the rotations in \(R_{12}\) by
definition send hour tick-marks to hour tick-marks, we get a function \(\text {tick} : R_{12} \to T\) where for any
rotation \(r\) in \(R_{12}\) we have that \(\text {tick}(r) = r(\overline {0})\). That is, we send any rotation to where it moves time
zero. In fact, this function is invertible. That is, for any tick-mark on the clock, there
is a unique rotation that sends \(\overline {0}\) to that tick-mark, the rotation clockwise by that
many units. You can visualize this as you rotate the clock by dragging the top
tick-mark around, holding onto this point that starts at the top, and the rest of
the points follow along. For this point to end at an hour tick-mark, there
are 12 possibilities. Here is a gif of the correspondence for the tick-mark
\(\overline {5}\).

<!-- l. 255 --><p class='indent'>   One possibility for where \(\overline {0}\) lands is back where it started, corresponding to the
identity rotation, leaving the clock unchanged. Otherwise it lands at one of the other
11 hour tick-marks, and so we get 12 possible rotations in total, the rotations \(C_{\text {rot}}(i)\) for \(0 \leq i \leq 11\)

</p><!-- l. 257 --><p class='indent'>   Now it’s time to compare these two perspectives. Let \(T = \{\overline {0}, \overline {1}, \dots , \overline {11}\}\) is the set of hour
tick-marks on the clock. Let \(\text {point} : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}\) be the function which takes a sliding action and
outputs the point it corresponds to, sending a sliding action \(s\) to the point \(s(0)\).
Let \(\text {tick} : R_{12} \to T\) be the function which takes a rotation on the clock and outputs the
corresponding hour tick-mark. That is, for any rotation \(r\) on the clock we have \(\text {tick}(r) = r(\overline {0})\). Then
we have a commutative diagram, which we will call the action diagram.

<!-- l. 271 --><p class='indent'>   This diagram says that the clock function turns sliding actions on the line, the
active passage of time, into rotational actions on the clock. Further, if you look at a
sliding action on the integers, watch where 0 goes, and then go to the corresponding
time on the clock, that’s the same as if you watch where the tick-mark \(\overline {0}\) goes under
the corresponding rotation action for the same amount of time, which is true and
demonstrated in this gif.

<!-- l. 281 --><p class='indent'>   Alternately, if you prefer to work more algebraically, then the commutativity of
this diagram asserts that for all integers \(i\) we have \begin {align*}  \text {tick}(C_{\text {rot}}(i)) &amp;= C(\text {point}(i)) \\ C_{\text {rot}}(i)(\overline {0}) &amp;= C(i),  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 286 --><p class='indent'>   that is, the time that it reads on the clock at hour \(i\) is the time we obtain by
letting \(i\) hours pass from the top tickmark at time \(0\), which is true.
</p><!-- l. 289 --><p class='indent'>   There are some special arithmetic properties of this function \(C_{\text {rot}}\) as well. To study
these, we give a special name to the rotation that does nothing to the clock,
corresponding to allowing no extra time to pass. We call this special rotation the
identity rotation, often shortened to just id (so named as each point maintains its
identity). First of all, we have that \(C_{\text {rot}}(12) = \operatorname {id}\), in that no matter what time on the clock it is,
12 hours later it will be the same time. This equality is highlighted in this gif.

<!-- l. 297 --><p class='indent'>   Furthermore, suppose we let 3 hours pass, then let 2 hours pass. On the number
line, we’ve slid over 3 units, then 2 units, overall sliding for 5 units. That is, addition
of numbers corresponds to composition of these sliding actions, which is a
beautiful result in and of itself. On the clock rotating by these 5 units is
decomposed as rotating 3 units, then rotating 2 units. Symbolically, we have an
operation on \(R_{12}\) where if we have two rotations \(r, s\), we get a new rotation \(r \circ s\), read
aloud as “\(r\) composed with \(s\)”, where we first apply \(s\), then apply \(r\). Then we
get the fundamental property \[ C_{\text {rot}}(i + j) = C_{\text {rot}}(i) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(j). \] Here is a gif that expresses this relationship
visually.

<!-- l. 308 --><p class='indent'>   The fact that the horizontal arrows in the tick-diagram are are invertible mean
that we have a way of combining tick-marks as well. That is, if you have two
tickmarks \(a, b\), these are the tick-marks associated to two unique rotations \(r\) and \(s\), that is \(a = \text {tick}(r)\)
and \(b = \text {tick}(s)\). Then we can define \(a + b = \text {tick}(r \circ s),\) an operation which was not so obvious thinking of these as
just points on a clock.
</p><!-- l. 310 --><p class='indent'>   Combining these properties yields some powerful results.
</p><!-- l. 312 --><p class='indent'>   For instance, if \(r, s\) are any two rotations on the clock, say \(\text {tick}(r) = \overline {i}\) and \(\text {tick}(s) = \overline {j}\). Then we have \(\text {tick}(r) = C(i)\) and
\(\text {tick}(s) = C(j)\), and so we have that \(r = C_{\text {rot}}(i)\) and \(s = C_{\text {rot}}(j)\). We then have \begin {align*}  r \circ s &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(i) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(j) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(i + j) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(j + i) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(j) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(i) \\ &amp;= s \circ r.  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 320 --><p class='indent'>   That is, if we have any two rotations, regardless of what order we compose them
in, we get the same overall rotation, a property which was not immediately
obvious.
</p><!-- l. 322 --><p class='indent'>   For another useful property, note that \begin {align*}  C_{\text {rot}}(17) &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(12 + 5) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(12) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(5) \\ &amp;= \operatorname {id} \circ C_{\text {rot}}(5) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(5)  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 329 --><p class='indent'>   So that the time on the clock 17 hours later is the same as the time 5 hours
later.
</p><!-- l. 331 --><p class='indent'>   Similarly, we get \begin {align*}  C_{\text {rot}}(28) &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(24 + 4) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(12 + 12 + 4) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(12) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(12) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(4) \\ &amp;= \operatorname {id} \circ \operatorname {id} \circ C_{\text {rot}}(4) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(4),  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 339 --><p class='indent'>   so that the time on the clock 28 hours later is the same as the time 4 hours later.
In general, when we perform division with remainder, we may write any positive
number \(i\) as \(i = 12 \cdot q + r\) with \(0 \leq r &lt; 12\) and \(q \geq 0\) an integer (that is we get \(12q\) is the largest multiple of 12 still
smaller than \(i\), and \(r = i - 12q\), e.g. \(36 = 3\cdot 12\) is the largest multiple of 12 that’s still smaller than \(39\), and so
we get \(39 = 3\cdot 12 + 3\)) so that \begin {align*}  C_{\text {rot}}(i) &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(12 \cdot q + r) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(12 \cdot q) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(r) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(\underbrace {12 + 12 + \dots + 12}_{q \text { times}}) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(r) \\ &amp;= \underbrace {C_{\text {rot}}(12) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(12) \circ \dots \circ C_{\text {rot}}(12)}_{q \text { times}} \circ C_{\text {rot}}(r) \\ &amp;= \underbrace {\operatorname {id} \circ \operatorname {id} \circ \dots \circ \operatorname {id}}_{q \text { times}} \circ C_{\text {rot}}(r) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(r)  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 349 --><p class='indent'>   This also works for negative numbers, as \(C_{\text {rot}}(-12) = \operatorname {id}\) as well (12 hours ago, it was the same
time on the clock as it is now). Because of this connection with division with
remainder, we will denote this group of rotations \(\mathbb {Z}/12\), to be read aloud as “Z mod 12”,
where mod is short for modular, as in modular arithmetic, another word for working
with these remainders.
</p><!-- l. 353 --><p class='indent'>   Now we ask the question, when do do two different amounts of time passing give
the same rotation on the clock? That is, when do we have \(C_{\text {rot}}(i) = C_{\text {rot}}(j)\)? Well, if we
write \(i = q\cdot 12 + r\) and \(j = t \cdot 12 + s\) with \(0 \leq r, s &lt; 12\), then we have \(C_{\text {rot}}(i) = C_{\text {rot}}(r)\) and \(C_{\text {rot}}(j) = C_{\text {rot}}(s)\), so \(C_{\text {rot}}(i) = C_{\text {rot}}(j)\) if and only if \(C_{\text {rot}}(r) = C_{\text {rot}}(s)\). I claim that this is
true if and only if \(r = s\). Indeed, if \(r = s\) then obviously \(C_{\text {rot}}(r) = C_{\text {rot}}(s)\). And furthermore, since \(0 \leq r, s &lt; 12\), we
have that \(C_{\text {rot}}(r)\) and \(C_{\text {rot}}(s)\) send the 0-hour tick-mark to the tick-marks labeled \(r\) and \(s\),
respectively. For these two rotations to be the same, we must then have that
\(r = s\).
</p><!-- l. 355 --><p class='indent'>   Thus, we have that two different amounts of time give the same rotation on the
clock if and only if they have the same remainder mod 12. That is, we can
simultaneously write \begin {align*}  i &amp;= q \cdot 12 + r \\ j &amp;= t \cdot 12 + r.  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 360 --><p class='indent'>   Subtracting these two equations yields \begin {align*}  i - j &amp;= q \cdot 12 + r - (t \cdot 12 + r) \\ &amp;= q \cdot 12 + \not {r} - t \cdot 12 - \not {r} \\ &amp;= q \cdot 12 - t \cdot 12 \\ &amp;= (q - t) \cdot 12,  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 367 --><p class='indent'>   so that \(i - j\) is divisible by 12. Similarly, if \(i - j\) is divisible by 12, say \(i - j = 12 \cdot k\) then \(i = 12 \cdot k + j\) and \[ C_{\text {rot}}(i) = C_{\text {rot}}(12 \cdot k + j) = C_{\text {rot}}(12 \cdot k) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(j) = C_{\text {rot}}(j), \] as
before. Thus, we have that \[ C_{\text {rot}}(i) = C_{\text {rot}}(j) \iff i - j \text { is divisible by } 12. \]
</p><!-- l. 376 --><p class='indent'>   The commutativity of the action diagram means that all of these results hold for \(C\)
as well. For instance, suppose we write \(i = 12q + r\) with \(0 \leq r \leq 11\), then we have \begin {align*}  C(i) &amp;= C(12q + r) \\ &amp;= C(\text {point}(12q + r)) \\ &amp;= \text {tick}(C_{\text {rot}}(12q + r) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(12q + r)(\overline {0})) &amp;&amp; \text {(commutativity of the action diagram)} \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(12q) \circ C_{\text {rot}}(r)(\overline {0}) \\ &amp;= \operatorname {id} \circ C_{\text {rot}}(r)(\overline {0}) \\ &amp;= C_{\text {rot}}(r)(\overline {0}) \\ &amp;= \text {tick} \circ C_{\text {rot}}(r) \\ &amp;= C(r)  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 389 --><p class='indent'>   Because of this, from here on out we will stop being so formal about the difference
between \(C\) and \(C_{\text {rot}}\), between points on the line and sliding actions, and between hour
tick-marks and rotations on the clock, where which interpretation we mean should be
clear from context.
</p><!-- l. 401 --><p class='indent'>   The final insight here is that there was nothing special about 12. For
                                                                  

                                                                  
any positive integer \(n\), we could consider measuring time on an \(n\)-hour clock,
which is best represented as an \(n\)-gon, a polygon with \(n\) sides connecting the
hour tickmarks. Then again we’d have the group \(\mathbb {Z}/n\) of rotations of this \(n\)-gon
which send hour tickmarks to hour tickmarks, i.e. those which send the
vertices of the \(n\)-gon to other vertices of the \(n\)-gon. And again we’d have a
function \(C : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}/n\) with \(C(i)\) being the time on the clock it is at time \(i\). Again we’d have the

<!-- l. 420 --><p class='noindent'>The main idea of a solo siteswap starts with imagining a juggler making throws and
catches evenly spaced out in time. Assigning an integer to every beat, we get an
association where the elements of \(\mathbb {Z}\) corresponds to beats in a juggling pattern. At any
given beat, we can track when the ball thrown at that beat is thrown again.
This gives us what we’ll define as a <span class='cmti-10'>Juggling function</span> \(S : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}\) defined by \(S(i) = j\) means
the ball thrown at beat \(i\) is thrown again at beat \(j\) (using the letter S for
siteswap). To be totally precise, it is entirely possible for a juggler to make no
throws at a given beat (maybe they’ve flashed all the balls high to make room
to clap or spin around). So at any beat \(i\) where no throw occurs, we define
\(S(i) = i\).
</p><!-- l. 422 --><p class='indent'>   If we study the properties of this function, a few rise up to greet us:
     </p><dl class='enumerate-enumitem'><dt class='enumerate-enumitem'>
 (1) </dt><dd class='enumerate-enumitem'>\(S\) is <span class='cmti-10'>rightward-moving</span>, in the sense that \(S(i) \geq i\) for all integers \(i\).
     </dd><dt class='enumerate-enumitem'>
 (2) </dt><dd class='enumerate-enumitem'>If we assume that the pattern has no collisions, then no two balls thrown
     at different beats land at the same time. That is, if \(i \neq j\) then \(S(i) \neq S(j)\), though we’ll
     more commonly use the formulation that if \(S(i) = S(j)\) then \(i = j\). In math lingo, this says
     that the function \(S\) is <span class='cmbx-10'>one to one/injective</span>
                                                                  

                                                                  
     </dd><dt class='enumerate-enumitem'>
 (3) </dt><dd class='enumerate-enumitem'>In order to make a throw at beat \(i\), the juggler must have caught a ball
     from some other throw in the past. That is, for any integer \(i\) where a throw
     is made, there must be some integer \(j\) with \(j &lt; i\) and \(S(j) = i\). And at any beat where
     no throw is made, we have \(S(i) = i\), regardless, every integer \(i\) is \(S(\text {something})\). In math lingo,
     this says that the function \(S\) is <span class='cmbx-10'>onto/surjective</span></dd></dl>
<!-- l. 432 --><p class='indent'>   Combining these properties yields that \(S\) shuffles the integers around somehow, but
that’s all it does, re-ordering the integers. In particular we can define an inverse
function \(S^{-1} : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}\) where we send an integer \(j\) to the unique integer \(i\) with \(S(i) = j\). Such an \(i\) exists
because \(S\) is onto, and is unique because \(S\) is one to one. That is, the equations \(S(i) = j\) and \(i = S^{-1}(j)\)
are equivalent to each other. In math lingo, this is saying that \(S\) is a rightward-moving
permutation of the integers.
</p><!-- l. 434 --><p class='indent'>   Furthermore, property (1) allows us to define an associated function \(T : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {N}\)
given by \(T(i) = S(i) - i\) called the <span class='cmti-10'>throw height </span>function. That is, at any beat \(i\), \(T(i)\) tells you
how many beats later the juggler will throw the ball at that beat. If you
keep the amount of time a ball spends in your hands before it is thrown
(called dwell time) constant, this is equivalent to specifying how high you
throw the ball at beat \(i\). Indeed, as may be familiar to jugglers, T(i) = 5
often means you throw the ball at beat \(i\) to the height of your 5 ball pattern,
though there is certainly room to fudge these heights. The function \(T\) is best
thought of as instructions to the juggler, ”throw the ball this height at this
beat”, and the function \(S\) is best thought of as observations of the juggler –
recording the results of executing those instructions, where the balls go over
time.
</p><!-- l. 436 --><p class='indent'>   The throw height function and the juggling function come hand in
hand. Above we’ve shown how to recover \(T\) from \(S\), but you can also build
\(S\) from \(T\) by defining \(S(i) = i + T(i)\), and indeed this is usually the order jugglers prefer.

<!-- l. 454 --><p class='indent'>   Many juggling tricks have a periodic nature to them, where after a certain
number of throws they’re back to where they started. In the juggling diagram above,
we can see that shifting the whole diagram over by 3 units leaves the picture
unchanged (though the colors get swapped around), which you can verify by just
noting that any two successive peaks of arches of the same height are distance 3
apart. So we add one extra condition to these patterns to capture this periodicity.
This extra condition can be stated in multiple equivalent ways, as given in the
following lemma.

<span class='cmti-10'>Proof.</span> </span>
</p><!-- l. 488 --><p class='indent'>   The first condition in this lemma with \(q = 1\) is maybe the simplest definition of
periodicity. No matter what throw you’re making now, \(n\) beats later you’ll be
making it again. The last condition in the lemma says that whenever your \(n\)-hour
clock winds back around to the same tick-mark, you make the same throw, also
a natural definition of periodicity. These are the same condition, as we saw in
section 3 that \(C(i) = C(j)\) if and only if \(j = i + qn\) for some integer \(q\), so we make the same throw
whenever we hit a given tick-mark on the clock, if and only if we make the same
throw whenever the times differ by a multiple of \(n\).
</p><!-- l. 490 --><p class='indent'>   If you want to get fancy with it, condition (2) is stating that \(S\) is equivariant with
respect to the action of the (sub)group \(n\mathbb {Z}\), a very nice kind of mathematical symmetry
indeed. Rearranging (2) to \(S(i + qn) - S(i) = qn\) and plugging in the definition of throw heights gives
\begin {align*}  i + qn + T(i + qn) - (i + T(i)) = qn \iff T(i + qn) - T(i) = 0,  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 494 --><p class='indent'>   where the symbol \(\iff \) means the equality to the left of the arrow holds if and only if
the equality to the right arrow holds, they are equivalent to each other.
The second equality is the equality in (1) rearranged, so conditions (1) and
(2) are equivalent. Heuristically, this says that if two throws differ in time
by some number of loops around the clock, then so do the catches, which
makes sense as the catches are both the same distance forward from the
throws, so the distance between the catches equals the distance between the
throws.

do this, note that by the periodicity assumption, whenever the clock winds around to

desired position, \(\widetilde {T}(\overline {i})\) ticks of the clock later. This shows that the diagram commutes,
concluding the proof.

It’s a little more challenging to show that if \(\widetilde {S}\) is a permutation, then \(S\) is a juggling

   <div class='proof'>
<!-- l. 589 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='head'>
<span class='cmti-10'>Proof.</span> </span>Let \(S : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}\) be a juggling function of period \(n\). By our reasoning at the beginning of
this section there is a function \(S^{-1} : \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z}\) such that \(S \circ S^{-1} = S^{-1} \circ S = \operatorname {id}\). I claim that \(S^{-1}\) is also periodic of period \(n\).
That is, we want to show that for any \(i\) in \(\mathbb {Z}\) that \[ S^{-1}(i + n) = S^{-1}(i) + n. \] To see this, we compute
\begin {align*}  i + n &amp;= S(S^{-1}(i)) + n \\ &amp;= S(S^{-1}(i) + n),  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 598 --><p class='indent'>   where the second equality holds because \(S\) has period \(n\). Applying \(S^{-1}\) on both sides
yields \[ S^{-1}(i + n) = S^{-1} \circ S(S^{-1}(i) + n) = S^{-1}(i) + n, \] where the second equality holds as \(S^{-1} \circ S(\text {blah}) = \text {blah}\). This shows that \(S^{-1}\) has period \(n\) as
well.
</p><!-- l. 604 --><p class='indent'>   Thus, applying the previous result to \(S^{-1}\) means there exists a unique function \(\widetilde {S^{-1}}\) such
that the following diagram commutes.

<!-- l. 613 --><p class='indent'>   I claim that \(\widetilde {S^{-1}} = \widetilde {S}^{-1}\). That is, the values of the inverse of \(S\) on the clock are exactly the
inverse to the values of \(S\) on the clock, which is a reasonable claim. We will
prove this in two different ways, by direct computation and by appeal to
diagrams.
</p><!-- l. 615 --><p class='indent'>   To show this by direct computation, note that for any tick-mark \(\overline {i}\) with \(0 \leq i &lt; n\) we have
that \(\overline {i} = C(i)\), and so we compute \begin {align*}  \widetilde {S^{-1}} \circ \widetilde {S}(\overline {i}) &amp;= \widetilde {S^{-1}} \circ \widetilde {S}(C(i)) \\ &amp;= \widetilde {S^{-1}}(C(S(i))) &amp;&amp; \text {(definition of $\widetilde {S}$)} \\ &amp;= C \circ S^{-1}(S(i)) &amp;&amp; \text {(definition of $\widetilde {S^{-1}}$)} \\ &amp;= C(i) \\ &amp;= \overline {i}.  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 623 --><p class='indent'>   Since this holds for all tick-marks on the clock, we have that \(\widetilde {S^{-1}} \circ \widetilde {S} = \operatorname {id}\), and we can
similarly show that \(\widetilde {S} \circ \widetilde {S^{-1}} = \operatorname {id}\), which is the desired result.

<span class='cmti-10'>Proof.</span> </span>Applying the previous result, we just need to show that \(\widetilde {S}\) is a permutation
(one to one and onto) if and only if it is one to one. We have the easy implication
that being a permutation implies being one to one by definition, so we just need
to prove the reverse implication.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 689 --><p class='indent'>   So now we have to how that if \(\widetilde {S}\) is one to one, it is also onto. We instead prove
the contrapositive, that if \(\widetilde {S}\) is not onto, then it is not one to one. We imagine
the function \(\widetilde {S}\) as some way of taking \(n\) balls, labeled with the numbers 1 to \(n\), and
placing them in \(n\) buckets, also labeled with the numbers 1 to \(n\), where \(\widetilde {S}(i)\) is the
label of the bucket we place ball \(i\) in.
</p><!-- l. 691 --><p class='indent'>   If \(\widetilde {S}\) is not onto, then we are placing \(n\) balls into fewer than \(n\) buckets. Thus,
there must be some bucket that has more than one ball in it, an argument often
referred to in mathematics as the pigeonhole principle. For example, if you are
trying to place 5 balls into 3 buckets, then some bucket must have more than
one ball, as otherwise there’d only be space to place at most 3 balls.
                                                                 □
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 695 --><p class='indent'>   To get to the theory of Préchac transformations, we suggest a helpful way of
visualizing permutations of \(\mathbb {Z}/n\). As we’ve been doing, we view \(\mathbb {Z}/n\) as a collection of
symmetries of a regular \(n\)-gon, where the action of adding \(i\) is identified with rotating
the \(n\)-gon by an angle of \(2\pi \frac {i}{n}\) radians or \(360\frac {i}{n}^\circ \), or rotating the \(n\)-gon by \(i\) turns, where 1 turn
moves every vertex over by 1 counterclockwise. Note that in either case that adding \(n\)
is associated with rotating by \(2\pi \) radians or \(360^\circ \) or \(n\) full turns of the \(n\)-gon. That
is, adding \(n\) means doing nothing, which is what adding \(n = 0\) should do in \(\mathbb {Z}/n\). We
can identify the elements of \(\mathbb {Z}/n\) by labeling the vertices of the \(n\)-gon, so that
addition by \(i\) is the rotation sending the vertex labeled 0 to the vertex labeled
\(i\).
</p><!-- l. 697 --><p class='indent'>   Then we picture a permutation \(\widetilde {S} : \mathbb {Z}/n \to \mathbb {Z}/n\) as a decoration on the \(n\)-gon, drawing an arrow
pointing from vertex \(i\) to vertex \(j\) if \(\widetilde {S}(i) = j\). The statement that \(\widetilde {S}\) is a permutation means
exactly that every vertex on the \(n\)-gon has exactly one arrow pointing out of it to \(\widetilde {S}(i)\),
and exactly one arrow pointing into it, from \(\widetilde {S}^{-1}(i)\). The visceral meaning of the arrows is
that the arrow at vertex \(i\) represents the flight path of the ball thrown at beat \(i\), as
recorded on the clock.
</p><!-- l. 699 --><p class='indent'>   In these pictures, we’ll have the \(n\)-gon oriented clockwise, so that vertex \(i + 1\) is
immediately clockwise from vertex \(i\). Instead of labeling the vertices corresponding to
its element in \(\mathbb {Z}/n\), we’ll label it with the throw height at that beat, so at vertex \(i\) we’ll
write \(\widetilde {T}(i)\), some integer \(j\) chosen that moving clockwise around the \(n\)-gon \(j\) edges lands at
where the arrow from that vertex is pointing. Or alternately, so that \(\widetilde {S}(i) = C(\widetilde {T}(i))(i)\), which is
the rotational version of \(S(i) = T(i) + i\). Most geometrically, we have that mod \(n\), \(\widetilde {T}(i)\) is the
oriented distance from the tail to the tip of the arrow starting at vertex
\(i\).

<!-- l. 795 --><p class='indent'>   There’s an interesting property about patterns that these pictures make clear.
These pictures break up the vertices of the polygon into little cycles. For instance in
the pattern 531, the vertices labeled 5 and 1 are in one cycle, while the vertex labeled
3 is in its own cycle. This means that we can color code this pattern, so that all the
balls throwing 5s and 1s are one color, while the balls throwing 3s are another color.
In fact there are two balls throwing the 5s and 1s, while one ball throws the 3, as you
can verify by looking at the juggling function diagram towards the beginning of this
section.
</p><!-- l. 797 --><p class='indent'>   Similarly the pattern 6451 breaks up into two cycles, one among the throws 6, 5,
and 1, and the other being the 4, so we can again color code this pattern into 2
colors, say juggled with 3 red balls throwing 6, 5, 1 and 1 blue ball throwing 4s. Or in
the pattern 97531, we can see three cycles, and we can color code this pattern with 3
colors.
</p><!-- l. 799 --><p class='indent'>   Another property that these pictures make clear is that if you take one of these
pictures and then perform any symmetry of the \(n\)-gon, you’ll end up with another
picture of the same type, a decoration of the \(n\)-gon with arrows forming a permutation
of the vertices. Furthermore, if you perform a rotation, then the throw heights will
also be unchanged, just counted in a different cycle, as the throw heights are read as
the oriented distance between the tail and tip of arrows. Or alternately, if we take
two times that are say 3 hours apart on the clock and let any amount of time pass,
those two times will remain 3 hours apart. Or in fancy language if \(y = C(3)(x)\), then we get
\begin {align*}  C(801)(y) &amp;= C(801) \circ C(3)(x) \\ &amp;= C(801 + 3)(x) \\ &amp;= C(3 + 801)(x) \\ &amp;= C(3) \circ C(801)(y),  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 805 --><p class='indent'>   so if \(y' = C(801)(y)\) and \(x' = C(801)(x)\) we still have \(y' = C(3)(x')\).
</p><!-- l. 807 --><p class='indent'>   This process is expressed visually in <span class='underline'><span id='textcolor3'><a href='https://media.giphy.com/media/qHU4VNXsjBB0HaAAcK/giphy.gif'>this gif</a></span></span>, where the siteswap 6451 rotates
three turns clockwise to become 4516. There’s an interesting phenomenon here, that
the new first throw is the throw that originally occurred three beats before the end.
Similarly if you wanted to say start some pattern two beats later, that would
correspond to rotating the picture two turns counterclockwise.
</p><!-- l. 809 --><p class='indent'>   The two types of symmetries of the \(n\)-gon are rotations and reflections. Rotations
don’t change throw heights for solo patterns, as we’ve seen above. Reflections have a
more complicated effect on the throw heights, which while interesting, won’t lead us
towards the Préchac transformation. We’ll discuss reflections in an appendix at the
end for those interested.

transformation.

<!-- l. 832 --><p class='indent'>   To turn one of these throws into a pass means to take an arrow with tail in one
square, and move its tip to the other square. Our first alteration to the pattern
is to choose one throw in the pattern, and turn it into a pass by having
both jugglers make that throw at the same height, but to the other person.
This corresponds in the diagram to picking an arrow from each pattern, and
swapping the locations of their tips. Here is the result from turning the 5 into a
pass.

</p><!-- l. 856 --><p class='indent'>   What we’ve stumbled upon here is symmetric same time passing. Two
jugglers juggle the same solo pattern at the same time, and on the same beat
pass an object that they were going throw as a self at the original throw
height. Standard 6 club 2-count, 3-count, ultimates, or any other similar
pattern all follow this form, as do 2-count patterns with even numbers of
clubs.
</p><!-- l. 858 --><p class='indent'>   To see why this always produces a valid juggling pattern, we just need to verify
that at every vertex in the picture, there is exactly one arrow pointing in, and one
arrow pointing out. Swapping the locations of the tips of two arrows doesn’t
change the number of arrows pointing out anywhere. Say we swap the tips of
arrows \(A\) and \(B\) landing at positions \(x\) and \(y\), respectively. Before the swap, \(A\) was \(x\)’s
inward-pointing arrow, and \(B\) was \(y\)’s inward-pointing arrow. After the swap \(A\) is
\(y\)’s inward pointing arrow, and \(B\) is \(x\)’s inward-pointing arrow. So these two
vertices still have one arrow in and one arrow out, and since we haven’t
changed the arrows going in anywhere else, we still have a valid juggling
pattern.
</p><!-- l. 860 --><p class='indent'>   If we’re in the interest of making new patterns from old ones, we might be lead to
the idea of performing a symmetry of the \(n\)-gon on one of these two patterns.
Understanding how these patterns are changed with rotation is not well suited for
written prose, so instead I’ve made a youtube video describing the Préchac
transformation. This video contains the core of the whole discussion, feel free to
pause and rewind to think about it.

juggler’s pattern, effectively changing when the top juggler starts juggling their
throws relative to the bottom juggler. If you open that link and look to the
algebra view to the left, there are two sliders, one labeled ”pass”, and the
other labeled ”angle”. The first slider lets you switch between throwing the
5s as selves, when pass is 0, and throwing them as passes, when pass is 1.
The second slider lets you rotate the top juggler, from an angle of 0, where
both patterns are lined up, to an angle of \(180^\circ \), where the top juggler has been
rotated halfway around, all the way back around to an angle of \(360^\circ \). You can

<!-- l. 888 --><p class='indent'>   Note that at the exact same moment one juggler is throwing a pass, the other
juggler is throwing the 1 as a zip across. Not also that the throw heights are
all the same as for solo juggling, a 3p goes about as high as a regular 3,
which is one of the main advantages of Préchac notation from a practical
standpoint. The color coding is also interesting. Note that the white clubs are
never passed, and the red clubs are always looped as a 3 from one juggler
to themselves, a 3p to the other juggler, then the same loop for the other
juggler.
</p><!-- l. 892 --><p class='indent'>   I made this animation using <span class='underline'><span id='textcolor5'><a href='http://westerboer.net/w/?page_id=151'>JoePass</a></span></span>, a great piece of software for animating all
kinds of juggling patterns with many jugglers. If you want to watch videos of jugglers
doing Préchac patterns I highly recommend <span class='underline'><span id='textcolor6'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/clubpassing/'>Jorge and Santi’s instagram</a></span></span>. They
post a lot of great patterns, usually include the Préchac notation in the
description, and often color code the patterns to make the underlying math
clearer.
</p><!-- l. 894 --><p class='indent'>   Let’s be a little more systematic about the process that I described in the video.
We start with two jugglers juggling the same pattern of period \(n\) at the same time as
each other, represented as two decorated \(n\)-gons stacked vertically one above the other.
The we start to rotate the top \(n\)-gon clockwise, corresponding to the top juggler
starting their pattern after the bottom juggler. After making \(t\) turns, the top juggler
is now making their pass \(t\) beats later, and so their pass’s throw height decreases by
\(t\).
</p><!-- l. 896 --><p class='indent'>   Similarly the beat the bottom juggler is aiming for in the top juggler’s
pattern now happens \(t\) beats later, and so their pass’s throw height increases by
\(t\).
</p><!-- l. 898 --><p class='indent'>   Without doing any further alterations, this is a great way for generating relatively
simple asymmetric passing patterns, where the two jugglers have the same selves but
different passes. The idea for the Préchac transformation is that if we rotate
juggler B’s pattern half of the way around, then we can ensure that both
jugglers have the same passes and selves, but are thrown at different times.
Mathematically, this is the statement that \(C(n/2) = C(-n/2)\), which is true as \(n - n/2 = n/2\), so \[ C(n/2) = C(n - n/2) = C(n) \circ C(-n/2) = \operatorname {id} \circ C(-n/2) = C(-n/2). \] That is, rotating
juggler B by \(n/2\) turns means we increase the value of juggler \(A\)’s pass by \(n/2\), and
decrease juggler \(B\)’s pass by \(-n/2\). Since \(C(n/2) = C(-n/2)\), we can choose these throw heights to be the
same.
</p><!-- l. 904 --><p class='indent'>   The most natural choices for symmetric throw heights we get by either adding \(n/2\) to
both passes, or subtracting \(n/2\) from both passes (the same operation on the clock).
These are the staggered symmetric passing patterns that have been growing in
popularity among jugglers worldwide, arguably most famously with the Gandini
jugglers.
</p><!-- l. 906 --><p class='indent'>   One beautiful thing about this is that the process works exactly the
same way if \(n\) is odd. Take two copies of a permutation on the \(n\)-gon, swap
the landing sites of a corresponding pair of throws, then rotate one \(n\)-gon
halfway around. Below is an <span class='underline'><span id='textcolor7'><a href='https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/djjwyzvx'>interactive animation</a></span></span> you can walk through in the
odd case, turning the pattern 423 into the Préchac pattern 2.5p23 (here
the period is \(n = 3\), and so subtracting half the period is subtracting 1.5 from

<!-- l. 915 --><p class='indent'>   Here is an animation of the pattern. Note that one juggler throws their self a half
beat after the other juggler throws their pass, corresponding to the fact that when
you rotate a triangle halfway around, the vertices now live exactly on the midpoints
of where the edges used to be. The same is true for any odd polygon, a kind of
juggler’s version of a musical canon. Rotating an even polygon halfway around
lands back aligned with itself, so jugglers juggling an even period Préchac
pattern have their metronomes perfectly synced up. True to form, notice
that these 2.5p throws are a little lower and faster than a 3p, often called a
”zap”.

the blue club is always thrown as a 1.5p, and the rest are alternating between 4 and
2. Notice how Jorge’s throws occur right in between Santi’s throws. This is a
Préchac transformation of the 3 object pattern 423 where we subtracted half the
period from the 3. Notice that the number of clubs is \(5 = 2 \cdot 3 - 1\). Or alternately we
could think of this as a Préchac transformation of the 2 object pattern
420 where we add half the period to the 0. Then the number of clubs is \(5 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1\).
This happens in general, that transforming up means you get one more
than twice the number of props, and transforming down means you have
one less than twice the number of props. We’ll go into this in more detail
later.

whenever one juggler is throwing the 2p, the other juggler is throwing the throw 2
beats earlier/later, the 1 as a quick zip across. This is a Préchac transformation of
the 3 object pattern 5124 where we subtract half the period from the 4, and again
the number of clubs is \(2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 5\).
</p><!-- l. 928 --><p class='indent'>   Now we take a moment to discuss color coding in the Préchac patterns. First,
here’s a video walking through the case of the pattern 3p313.

<!-- l. 937 --><p class='indent'>   This same process will always happen with Préchac patterns. Say you
transform the first throw in the pattern. When juggled as a solo pattern,
on the clock let the beats this throw loops through be \(0, i_1, i_2, \dots , i_\ell , 0\) for some values \(i_j\),
where \(i_\ell \) is thrown back to beat 0 on the clock. Turning both juggler’s throws
at beat 0 into a pass at the same height, my throw at beat 0 now lands
                                                                  

                                                                  
in your beat \(i_1\). Then it loops around to your beats \(i_2, i_3, \dots , i_\ell , 0\). Then since your clock
has ticked back around to 0, you throw it to my beat \(i_1\), which then cycles
around my beats \(i_2, i_3, \dots , i_\ell , 0\). So in total this throw travels its cycle around each of our
patterns before coming back to where it started, for a cycle that’s twice
as long as it originally was, and again these throws can all be made with
one color. This property is maintained after rotating, as it just stretches
out the arrows, not changing the overall cycle, as can be seen in the video
above.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='prechac-patterns-with-many-jugglers'><span class='titlemark'>6   </span> <a id='x1-90006'></a>Préchac patterns with many jugglers</h3>
<!-- l. 974 --><p class='noindent'>The theory with more jugglers proceeds along mostly the same lines. We
start with \(J &gt; 2\) jugglers juggling the same pattern at the same time. We’ll label
these jugglers with the integers \(0, 1, 2, \dots , J-1\). Then we first take a given beat \(j_0\) in the
pattern and have all jugglers pass the throw at beat \(j_0\) at the same height as
before.
</p><!-- l. 976 --><p class='indent'>   There are now many choices of who to pass to. Recording for every juggler who
they pass to gives us a function \(P : \{0, 1, \dots , J-1\} \to \{0, 1, \dots , J-1\}\) where if juggler \(a\) passes to juggler \(b\) then we set \(P(a) = b\). To
ensure that everyone receives an object on the beat where throw \(j_0\) lands means
that \(P\) is onto. To ensure that no juggler receives two objects when they were
expecting one, we must have that \(P\) is one to one, so altogether we have that \(P\) is a
permutation. If we have some small cycle like \(P(0) = 1\), \(P(1) = 2\), and juggler 2 looping back around
with \(P(2) = 0\), then those three jugglers are passing amongst themselves separate
from the other jugglers, which begs the question of why we gathered all \(J\)
jugglers together in the first place (and mathematically they’ll be doing
a Préchac transformation with 3 jugglers). Thus, we may assume that \(P\)
cycles through every juggler, and so after renumbering the jugglers we may
assume that \(P\) is the cyclic permutation \(P(i) = i + 1\) for \(0 \leq i &lt; J-1\) and \(P(J-1) = 0\), written more compactly as
\(P(i) = i + 1 \pmod J\).
</p><!-- l. 978 --><p class='indent'>   Thus, we have as before a symmetric same-time passing pattern by turning
one throw into a pass for every juggler. Then we can rotate any of these
juggler’s patterns to get new passing patterns as a result, many of them
asymmetric. If we rotate juggler \(i\) clockwise a fraction \(A/B\) of a full rotation, then the
incoming throw from juggler \(i - 1\) takes \(n*A/B\) beats longer to arrive (mod \(n\)), and the
outgoing throw from juggler \(i\) to juggler \(i + 1\) is in the air for \(n*A/B\) fewer beats. The most
symmetric choice comes from evenly spreading the rotation around these
jugglers. With two jugglers, we saw that the most symmetric result came
from having the second juggler rotated halfway around relative to the first
juggler. Here we get the best result by following the same idea all the way
around the passing cycle, each juggler rotated a fraction \(1/J\) of the way around
relative to the previous juggler (who they’re receiving passes from). Adding up
these successive rotations means that juggler \(i\) is rotated clockwise \(i/J\) of the
whole way around, for a total of \(n(i/J)\) turns. Practically speaking, I think of this
as any juggler starts throwing \(n/J\) beats after the juggler passing to them, as
\(n(1/J) = n/J\).
</p><!-- l. 980 --><p class='indent'>   In particular, the throw leaving from juggler \(i\) is changed by rotating closer a
fraction \(i/J\), so it’s decreased by this rotation, but it’s also increased by the next juggler
rotating away a fraction \((i+1)/J\), so the overall number change to the throw value is
\begin {align*}  n\left (\frac {i + 1}{J} - \frac {i}{J} \right ) &amp;= \frac {n}{J}.  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 984 --><p class='indent'>   Alternately, to get the same value on the clock we could have some or all of the
jugglers decrease their throw value by \(\frac {(J-1)n}{J}\), as mod \(n\) we have \[ \frac {n}{J} + \frac {n(J-1)}{J} = \frac {n + n(J-1)}{k} = \frac {n(1 + (J - 1))}{J} = \frac {nJ}{J} = n \] so \[ C\left (\frac {n}{J} \right ) = C\left (n - \frac {n(J-1)}{J}\right ) = C(n) \circ C\left ( - \frac {n(J-1)}{J}\right ) = C\left ( - \frac {n(J-1)}{J}\right ). \]

<!-- l. 993 --><p class='noindent'>Each juggler is rotated by \(n/J\) beats relative to the partner they’re receiving passes from.
That means that when juggler \(i\) makes a throw \(A\), \(n/J\) beats later, juggler \(i + 1\) will make the
same throw. Letting \(k\) be the smallest integer so that \(\frac {n - k}{J}\) is an integer, we get that the
throw juggler \(i + 1\) makes at beat \(\frac {k}{J}\) after juggler \(i\) is the throw \[ \frac {n}{J} - \frac {k}{J} = \frac {n - k}{J} \] beats before throw

jugglers are throwing at the same time in the pattern (not necessarily throwing
their passes at the same time) if \[ \frac {nj}{J} - \frac {ni}{J} = \frac {n(j-i)}{J} \] is an integer. Furthermore, these two jugglers
will also be throwing their passes at the same time exactly when this fraction
is an integer divisible by \(n\). To see that the latter situation is always impossible,
note that if this fraction is an integer divisible by \(n\), then we have \[ \frac {n(j-i)}{J} = nr \iff \frac {j - i}{J} = r, \] with \(r\) an
integer. This is impossible, as for any \(i, j\) with \(0 \leq i, j &lt; J\) we get that \(|j - i| &lt; J\), so \(\left | \frac {j - i}{J}\right | &lt; 1\), so for this fraction
to be an integer, it must be zero, which implies \(j = i\).
</p><!-- l. 1043 --><p class='indent'>   So all that remains is to show that \(\frac {n(j-i)}{J}\) is an integer exactly when \(J'\) divides \(j - i\).
To do this, we compute \[ \frac {n(j-i)}{J} = \frac {(j-i)n/d}{J/d} = \frac {n'(j-i)}{J'} \] Since \(n'\) and \(J'\) are relatively prime (have no factors in
common), this is an integer exactly when \(J'\) divides \(j - i\). So two jugglers are synced
up in time if and only if they differ by a multiple of \(J'\) in the throwing order.
                                                                 □

<!-- l. 1054 --><p class='noindent'>Let’s say first we’re juggling a Préchac-transformed odd-length pattern with two
jugglers. As we’ve discussed previously, this means we have two \(n\)-gons pictured one
above the other, with arrows pointing from the throw origin to the throw
destination. Since the pattern is of odd length, the two jugglers never throw at the
same time, and indeed all the throws are spaced out exactly half a beat
apart.
</p><!-- l. 1056 --><p class='indent'>   We can build a solo pattern on a \(2n\)-gon that captures this data by simply
projecting both \(n\)-gons down onto a \(2n\)-gon placed below each. The image here is if we
were to shine a light down from above either \(n\)-gon, we draw their shadow on the \(2n\)-gon
below. Or alternately you can think about this as merging the two \(n\)-gons together.
Here is an interactive animation of the process for the pattern 421.5p. There is
a slider labeled height, and you can drag that value around to move the
two triangles down toward the hexagon, or hit the play button to watch an
animation. In addition, you can click and drag around the picture to move the

<!-- l. 1066 --><p class='indent'>   To understand what happens to throw heights, note that traversing two edges in
this \(2n\)-gon corresponds to traversing one edge in the \(n\)-gon it came from. So if the throw
                                                                  

                                                                  
values on the \(n\)-gon give an oriented number of edges traveled around the \(n\)-gon,
in this new pattern that same throw has to traverse twice as many edges.
That is, all the throw values are doubled, as you can verify in the example
above.
</p><!-- l. 1068 --><p class='indent'>   The process is similar for a Préchac pattern with \(J\) jugglers and \(n\) and \(J\) coprime.
There we get \(J\) distinct rotations of the \(n\)-gon, which project down onto an
\(nJ\)-gon, and traversing \(J\) edges on this larger \(nJ\)-gon corresponds to traversing \(1\)
edges in any of the jugglers’ \(n\)-gons, and so throw values all get multiplied by
\(J\).

<span class='cmti-10'>Proof.</span> </span>We prove this here only in the case of odd period patterns with two
jugglers, which readily generalizes to patterns with \(J\) jugglers of period relatively
prime to \(J\). The appendix has a proof for the other cases.
</p><!-- l. 1089 --><p class='indent'>   Every one of the \(U\) throws that gets shifted up increases the throw value by \(\frac {n}{2}\),
and every one of the \(D\) throws that gets shifted down decreases its throw
value by \(\frac {n}{2}\). Thus, we have that \[ \sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1} T^{pre}(i) = \frac {Un}{2} - \frac {Dn}{2} + \sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1} T(i). \] For a two-person Préchac pattern, when
thought of as a one-person siteswap, each throw gets thrown twice at twice its
throw value. So in computing the average of throw heights for the one-person
pattern, each throw contributes 4 times its value to the sum (both jugglers
make throws of twice the value), and the total number of throws, which
we’re dividing by, is \(2n\). Combining these pieces of reasoning, we compute

result.
</p><!-- l. 1104 --><p class='indent'>   For even period patterns, the jugglers are throwing at the same time, and as is
customary in synchronous patterns, we add in an extra beat between pairs of throws
(corresponding to the fact that synchronous patterns tend to be juggled at half the
speed of asynchronous patterns), and double the throw value, and the average
theorem is expressed the same way as above, as adding in this extra beat in between
throws doubles the period in much the same way interweaving the two odd-length
patterns did above.

<!-- l. 1139 --><p class='indent'>   First let’s suppose that \(S\) is a juggling function (that is, it is one to one and onto),
and show that \(\widetilde {S}\) is a permutation.
</p><!-- l. 1141 --><p class='indent'>   To show that \(\widetilde {S}\) is one to one, suppose that we two times on the clock \(\overline {i}\) and \(\overline {j}\) in \(\mathbb {Z}/n\) such
that \(\widetilde {S}(\overline {i}) = \widetilde {S}(\overline {j})\). This means that for any times \(a\) and \(b\) with \(\overline {i} = C(a)\) and \(\overline {j} = C(b)\) on the clock, that \(S(a)\) and \(S(b)\) yield
the same time on the clock. Then we have that \(S(b) = S(a) + nq\) for some integer \(q\). But then by
periodicity we have \[ S(a + nq) = S(a) + nq = S(b). \]
</p><!-- l. 1145 --><p class='indent'>   Since \(S\) is one to one, we get that \(b = a + nq\), and so \[ \overline {i} = C(a) = C(b) = \overline {j} \]
</p><!-- l. 1149 --><p class='indent'>   To show that \(\widetilde {S}\) is onto, let \(\overline {i} \in \mathbb {Z}/n\). Then we have that \(\overline {i} = C(i)\). Since \(S\) is onto, we have that \(i = S(j)\) for
some integer \(j\). Thus we have that \begin {align*}  \overline {i} &amp;= C(i) \\ &amp;= C(S(j)) \\ &amp;= \widetilde {S}(C(j)),  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 1155 --><p class='indent'>   thus, we have that \(\overline {i}\) is hit by \(C(j)\) under \(\widetilde {S}\). Since \(r\) was arbitrary, we have that \(\widetilde {S}\) is
onto.
</p><!-- l. 1157 --><p class='indent'>   Now let’s suppose that \(\widetilde {S}\) is a permutation and show that \(S\) is a juggling function
(one to one and onto). To show that \(S\) is one to one, suppose that \(S(i) = S(j)\). Then we have that
\(C(S(i)) = C(S(j))\), and so we have that \(\widetilde {S}(C(i)) = \widetilde {S}(C(j))\). Since \(\widetilde {S}\) is one to one, we have that \(C(i) = C(j)\), and thus \(i = j + qn\) for some integer

</p><!-- l. 1165 --><p class='indent'>   Now let’s show that \(S\) is onto. To see this, let \(i \in Z\). Since \(\widetilde {S}\) is onto we have that at least
there is an element \(\overline {j} \in \mathbb {Z}/n\) so that \(\widetilde {S}(C(j)) = C(i)\). But then we have by commutativity of the
diagram that \(C(i) = C(S(j))\). Thus, we have that \(i = S(j) + qn\) for some integer \(q\). But by periodicity
we have \(i = S(j + qn)\), and so \(i\) is hit by \(j + qn\) under \(S\). Since \(i\) was arbitrary, we have that \(S\) is
onto.

</p><!-- l. 1293 --><p class='indent'>   We will instead prove the equivalent equality \[ nb = \sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1} T(i), \] by showing that both sides of
this equation count the total airtime of the balls in the pattern over the course
of a given period.
</p><!-- l. 1299 --><p class='indent'>   Let’s consider the interval of time between the first throw at beat 0, and
the \(n + 1\)th throw at beat \(n\). We will obtain the desired result by counting the total
airtime of balls during this interval in two different ways. To define airtime, we
imagine the ball thrown at a given beat as having landed at that beat and then
immediately being launched into the air. Or in other words, we ignore dwell
time, the amount of time a ball spends in the hand. So then the airtime of a ball
in this given window is the amount of time in this interval that the ball is not
in a hand. Since the ball is only in a hand for an instant at a time, this means
the airtime of a ball in this interval is just the length of this interval, which is \(n\).
Thus, if we let \(b\) denote the total number of balls in the pattern, the airtime in
this interval is simply \(nb\).
</p><!-- l. 1301 --><p class='indent'>   On the other hand, the ball thrown at beat \(i\) is launched into the air for
a total time of \(T(i)\), by definition of throw heights. So then counting the airtime
of balls launched in this interval we get \(\sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1} T(i)\) (the ball thrown at beat \(n\) spends all
its airtime outside the interval, so isn’t counted). In spirit, equating these two
views of airtime shows that these two are equal and gives us the result, and this
line of thinking is how I remember this proof. However, there are a couple of
issues that need to be addressed.
</p><!-- l. 1303 --><p class='indent'>   First  off,  adding  up  the  throw  heights  only  counts  the  airtime  of  balls
launched during this interval, so the airtime of balls thrown before this interval
that land during or after this interval have the portion of their airtime that
remains in this interval ignored. Similarly, some of the balls thrown during
this interval land after this interval, and so counting their full throw height
overcounts their airtime during this interval.
</p><!-- l. 1305 --><p class='indent'>   It turns out that the missing airtime from balls thrown before the window
that land during the window is exactly cancelled out by the overcounted airtime
from balls thrown during the window that land after the window. We’ll prove
this below. However, this still leaves the problem of balls thrown before the
window that land after the window, which haven’t entered our count at all. To
be clear, this absolutely happens, like in the pattern 64 of period 2, that pattern
has 5 balls, but the 4 thrown immediately before the 6 lands after this cycle, as
does the 6 thrown before that 4.
</p><!-- l. 1307 --><p class='indent'>   To resolve this last issue, we extend our window of observation so that no
ball is thrown higher than the length of our window. In particular, we select
an integer \(k\) such that \(nk\) is larger than the highest throw in our pattern. Then
looking at the window from \(0\) to \(nk\), the length of this window is \(nk\), and so the total
airtime is \(nkb\). Furthermore, since no ball is thrown at or higher than \(nk\), no ball can
be thrown before this interval and land after it. This also shows that every ball
in the pattern is thrown at least once during this window, and is a proof that
the number of balls is finite. Furthermore, this window is \(k\) copies of a full period
of the pattern. Thus, all the throw heights are repeated \(k\) times, and so the sum
                                                                  

                                                                  
of throw heights over this interval is \[ k \sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1} T(i) \]
</p><!-- l. 1312 --><p class='indent'>   Thus, our mission is to show by counting airtime that \[ nkb = \sum \limits _{i=0}^{nk - 1} T(i), \] which we have just
remarked equals \(k \sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1} T(i)\), and dividing on both sides by \(k\) (or \(nk\) if you prefer) yields the
desired result.
</p><!-- l. 1323 --><p class='indent'>   So now the balls in the air during this window can be sorted into three
distinct classes. Let \(B\) denote the throws made before the window that land during
the window, let \(D\) denote the throws made during the window that land during
the window, and let \(A\) denote the throws made during the window that land after
the window. If a beat \(i\) is in \(D\) it yield no problem, and contributes the expected \(T(i)\)
to the airtime during this interval. The two sets \(A\) and \(B\) are where the problems
lie, but it turns out their problems exactly cancel each other out.
</p><!-- l. 1325 --><p class='indent'>   I claim that there is a natural correspondence between \(A\) and \(B\). I claim that
we have a function \(f : A \to B\) sending a beat \(i \in A\) to the beat \(i - nk\), and a function \(G : B \to A\) sending a beat
\(i\) in \(B\) to the beat \(i + nk\). If these two functions do actually send points in \(A\) to points
in \(B\) and vice versa, then they are inverse to each other, as \([i + nk] - nk = i = [i - nk] + nk\). Furthermore, we
have by periodicity that \(T(f(i)) = T(i - nk) = T(i)\), and similarly \(T(g(i)) = T(i)\). So all that needs to be done is to show
that these two functions do have outputs in the prescribed places, and that the
combined airtime of two paired beats is their common throw value.
</p><!-- l. 1327 --><p class='indent'>   Let’s get cracking! First let’s suppose that \(i \in A\), so that \(i\) lands after the window, but \(i\)
is thrown during the window. That is, we have that \(S(i) &gt; nk\) but \(0 \leq i &lt; nk\). In terms of throw heights,
the first condition means that \(i + T(i) &gt; nk\). Since we have chosen \(nk\) to be larger than the maximum
throw height, we also get \(i + T(i) &lt; i + nk\). Subtracting \(nk\) from all of these inequalities yields
\begin {align*}  0 &lt; i - nk + T(i) &lt; i \\ -nk \leq i - nk &lt; 0.  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 1332 --><p class='indent'>   The second condition yields that \(f(i) = i - nk\) occurs before the window. For the first
condition, we note that \(T(i) = T(i - nk)\) by periodicity, and so \[ i - nk + T(i) = i - nk + T(i - nk) = S(i - nk), \] by definition of throw heights. Thus,
the first pair of inequalities yields \[ 0 &lt; S(f(i)) &lt; i, \] so \(f(i)\) lands during the window, as 0 and \(i\) are in the
window. That is \(f(i) \in A\). Similar reasoning shows that \(g : B \to A\) actually outputs beats in
\(A\).
</p><!-- l. 1340 --><p class='indent'>   To get the combined airtime of these balls, let \(i \in A\), so that the ball thrown at beat \(i\)
lands after the window. Then the airtime that this throw spends in the window just
the length of the interval from \(i\) to \(nk\), which is \(nk - i\). If we consider the throw at beat \(f(i) = i - nk\), then
the amount of airtime this ball spends in the window is just the length of the interval
from \(0\) to \(S(i - nk)\), which is \(S(i - nk)\). So the in-window airtime from these two throws is
\begin {align*}  S(i - nk) + nk - i &amp;= i - nk + T(i - nk) + nk - i \\ &amp;= T(i - nk) \\ &amp;= T(i),  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 1346 --><p class='indent'>   as desired. Thus, we have \begin {align*}  \text {total airtime} &amp;= \text {airtime from B} + \text {airtime from D} + \text {airtime from A} \\ &amp;= \text {airtime from D} + \sum \limits _{i \in A} \Big [ \text {airtime}(i) + \text {airtime}(f(i)) \Big ]\\ &amp;= \sum _{j \in D} T(j) + \sum \limits _{i \in A} T(i) &amp;&amp; \text {(by the above reasoning)} \\ &amp;= \sum \limits _{i = 0}^{nk - 1} T(i) \\ &amp;= \sum \limits _{q = 0}^{k-1} \sum \limits _{r=0}^{n-1} T(nq + r) \\ &amp;= \sum \limits _{q=0}^{k-1} \sum \limits _{r=0}^{n-1} T(r) \\ &amp;= k \sum \limits _{r=0}^{n-1} T(r),  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 1356 --><p class='indent'>   which is the desired result.
                                                                 □
</p>
   </div>
<!-- l. 1360 --><p class='indent'>   I’ll pause for some remarks on this proof and why I like it in addition to the
more standard argument you get by swapping throw heights to end up at
the base pattern for a given number of objects. First of all, the argument
generalizes immediately to multiplex patterns, as the fact that multiple balls
are thrown at once is irrelevant from the perspective of airtime, and there
it’s not so clear on how to do the standard siteswapping. This proof also
                                                                  

                                                                  
generalizes to the context of Préchac patterns. Indeed there you have \(J\) jugglers
making all \(n\) throws in an interval of length \(n\), either the throws are occurring
synchronously or not, but always they’re at rational points in time, and we
still have period \(n\), in the sense that even for fractional inputs \(i\) we have \(T(i + n) = T(i)\).
Thus, we get the total airtime as \(J \sum \limits _{i = 0}^{n-1} T(i)\), and so the number of balls is \(\frac {J \sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1} T(i)}{n}\). Like in the
pattern 421.5p for two jugglers we get the number of balls is \(\frac {2*(4 + 2 + 1.5)}{3} = 5\), which is correct
(it’s a Préchac transformation down from \(423\), which has 3 balls). This form
also makes it clear why the Préchac pattern has as many balls as it does.
Say we Préchac transform all the \(J\) jugglers’ passes up by \(\frac {n}{J}\) Then the sum
of throw heights is increased by \(J(n/J) = n\), and so the average is increased by 1. Or
similarly if we Préchac transform all of the jugglers’ passes down by \(\frac {n(J-1)}{J}\), then the
sum of the throw heights is decreased by \(\frac {Jn(J-1)}{J} = n(J-1)\), and the average is decreased
by \(J - 1\). In general say we transform \(U\) of the the jugglers’ throws up by \(n/J\), and
\(D = J - U\) of the jugglers’ down by \(\frac {n(J-1)}{J}\), then the sum of throw heights is changed by
\begin {align*}  \frac {Un}{J} - \frac {Dn(J-1)}{J} &amp;= \frac {n}{J} \Big (U - D(J-1) \Big ) \\ &amp;= \frac {n}{J}(U -DJ + D) \\ &amp;= \frac {n}{J}(J - DJ) \\ &amp;= n(1 - D),  \end {align*}
</p><!-- l. 1367 --><p class='indent'>   so the average is changed by \(1 - D\), with \(D = 0\) we get one extra object, with \(D = 1\) we get no
change to the number of objects, for \(D = 2\) we get one fewer object, and in general
increasing \(D\) by some number decreases the number of objects by the same
amount.
